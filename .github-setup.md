# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your shoe-store project is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `shoe-store` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "Full-stack sneaker collection e-commerce store with AI-powered identification"
4. Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/craigdalessio/shoe-store
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shoe-store.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: If you want me to set it up automatically

If you provide your GitHub username, I can help you set up the remote URL. Just let me know!
